A digital playground created with Julia Nuesslein, showing your image in a constant flux. The boundaries between reality and representation are fluid but influenced by the speed of your movements. If you slow down, you'll take control of your image. Otherwise the machine will take it. 
This work was done for the Responsive Spaces group show at Urban Spree (Berlin, 07/25/2014). Thanks to Rachel Uwa and schoolofma.org
